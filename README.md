*TODO*
 * Investigate adding YepNope to grunt-file to install and use
 * Check out MVC for lazy-loading some content based on device (using above?)
 * Figure out best templating to use with Yeoman / MVC / YepNope (see above)
 * Figure out if there's a HAML possibility / templating with Yeoman
 * Check out other BS components such as dropdowns and forms (for contact form and info)
 * ~~Find out more about how the JS is supposed to be structured with app.js and require.js etc.~~
